this project was fun and I learned alot and got alot of practice on debugging and I think I got better at it. 
This project was particularly challenging mainly because local storage is like my weakness haha. after I got the api portion down it wasnt too bad. but the local storage and getting items to apear and being able to click on them took more than half the time of the total project. 
overall I am happy that I was able to learn so much and get alot of practice. 

given the user opens the web app<br>
then the user is presented with a form input to input a city.<br>
when the user inputs a city<br>
then the user is presented with the current weather for the date, including temp description, max and min temp, humidity and wind speed<br>
when the user searches a city <br>
then the users input will be saved to local storage<br>
when the users input is saved to local storage <br>
then the users history will be saved to a list<br>
when the user clicks on a city in the histories list<br> <br>
then the weather is shown for that city<br>
I am unable to use that I was told to use because it is no longer free. teacher instruccted me to use another one. I am only able to show current day data and no UV.
